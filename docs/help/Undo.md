Undo a pattern configuration
----------------------------

Right click the ![link](images/link.png)
button on the [main] page for a link or bookmark
to the current configuration of the diagrams.

Left click the button for an undo point for your changes to the parameters or stitches.
Use the back button of the browser to return to a previously saved configuration.
Push the show buttons again after both actions.

[main]: /GroundForge/

When recalling the bookmark you will have to generate the diagrams again with the show button.
Your browser will automatically remember the choices you made on an example page.
The browser history gets lost when you close the browser, your bookmarks or favorites will stay.

Undo individual fields
----------------------

When the cursor is in a stitch field you can return to a previous choice
for that field with CTRL-Z (Windows, *nix systems) or COMMAND-Z (Mac),
FireFox and Chrome also let you choose from a list of previous values with the same start,
erase the field and the down or up arrow of your keyboard shows all your previous choices.
Depending on your browser settings, these values may stay for a next session.


Future safe link
----------------

Bugs fixed in the future might change the result of a pattern:
the stitches might nog longer match the pattern.

To make a link that doesn't change, use the button with a clock icon next to the link symbol.
It will lead you to the way back machine which will probably suggest to archive the page, confirm.
When it has been archive before, you will have to pick a marked date from a calender.

It may challenge your patience, but at least at a next visit
the page will render the same diagrams when applying the show buttons.
