Links, wand and undo   
====================

Some pages may have the following buttons:
![link](../images/link.png) and ![link](../images/wand.png)

The latter button (re)loads diagrams without reloading the page.

The first button reloads the page with the actual pattern configuration.

Undo complete pattern configurations
------------------------------------
When having second thoughts on changes made to a pattern
you can use the back button of your browser to return
to the pattern as it was when you used the first button.
When you used the latter button to inspect the result of your changes,
you'll have to undo changes made to individual form fields as explained below.

Create links
------------
The first button allows you to create links to a diagram to share
on your web-site, blog or where ever you like.
Known bug: When you right-click the button to create a link,
the link might be out of sync with the actual pattern configuration.
When you hover over it a second time it will be up to date.

The long links may be a problem in emails. At least two remedies are available:
* Use a [shortening service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)
* When you know how to make a mental map of form fields and address components (like stitches: `xxx=ctc`)
  you can try to leave the less essential out of the link
  and take the default value for granted, please test the result.
  
  
Future proof links
------------------
To make sure you can recover a page
(not just GroundForge but any web page that allows crawlers)
without changes made by future updates of the web site: save it in the
[Wayback Machine](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360001513491-Save-Pages-in-the-Wayback-Machine).

Undo individual fields
----------------------
When the cursor is in some free text field you can return to a previous choice
for that field with CTRL-Z (Windows, *nix systems) or COMMAND-Z (Mac),
For some fields, some browsers may let you choose from a list of previous values with the same start,
erase the field and the down or up arrow of your keyboard shows all your previous choices.
Depending on your browser settings, these values may stay for a next session.
