Thread Colors
=============

Pure white is is skipped as it blends in with the background,
the remaining colors are repeated if there are more threads.

You can use the mouse to select a color for a thread.
Typing colors is also possible.
To quickly set a sequence of colors into black or white
repeat tabbing to the next color and type `000` or `fff`.
