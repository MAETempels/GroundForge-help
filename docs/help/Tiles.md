Tiles
=====

The [tiles] page is a variant of the [home] page.
On the tiles page you can't use thread diagrams as pair diagrams,
but you don't need to wrap your brains around [assigning] stitches to id's.
It has only two colors in the thread diagram,
but you don't need to [calculate] thread counts
to give the desired ones a color.

Catalogues
----------
An overview of most catalogue pages is given, but when writing writing this, only some are linked:
only those that link back to the tiles page.
The main catalogues link leads to short introductions and links to all catalogue pages.
_For as long as the page is still under construction,
you may also choose a link from the image captions of the demo section
on the tiles page itself._

The links from a catalogue page fill out the forms below the diagrams.
These forms define a base pattern, advanced users may design
new base patterns with these forms.

You can vary stitches for the base patterns and check how
contrasting threads would travel through the ground.

Invisible diagrams
------------------
Under circumstances only one of the three diagrams is shown.
Use the link button (&infin;) to show all diagrams.

Reason:
Updating the other diagrams could use too much resources and block your system.
Outdated diagrams are cleared to avoid confusion about the state of the page.

Benefits:
Using the link button allows you to step back to that set of diagrams
with the back button of your browser.
The link button also allows you to create links to a diagram to share
on your web-site, blog or where ever you like.
The long links may be a problem in emails. You may consider to tuse a
[shortening service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)
for those occasions.

Patch size
----------
Note that a large patch size make a diagram slower to render.
On slow devices like tables and phones that might give
the impression that links to pages with large patch size don't work at all.
So create links with small patch sizes, visitors can easily increment.

Not all diagrams work with all values for the patch size.
Try other values if the thread diagram freezes at its initial state. 

Generating the diagrams at each increment or decrement would slow down
the process of changing values if not block the the computer altogether.
To prevent confusion about the state of the diagrams, they are cleared.
when you are done wih the planned changes you can use the link button
to show diagrams again. 

Choose stitches
---------------
The faint nodes in the prototype diagram are repeats of the bright ones.
Click on a bright nodes and a yellow form field should emerge with a code
for a stitch, for example `ctc` for a cloth stitch: cross-twist-cross.
Type as many `c`'s and `t`'s as you need for the stitch of your choice,
or use `l`'s and `r`'s for a left twist or right twist.

Microsofts Edge browser won't show the yellow form field when clicking a node.
Use the tab key or shift-tab to browse through all fields and links on the page.

Toggle thread colors
--------------------
You may have to scroll/drag the pair diagram to make
the squares at the start of the threads visible.
Click these squares to toggle between a black or red color.

A tooltip shows when your mouse hovers over a square. 
Too tiny squares or too close together? Use the zoom function of your browser.
Usually control-shift-plus to zoom in, control-zero to reset,
on a mac use command for control.

Download
--------
You can download the diagrams to edit them with an [SVG editor] such as:
- CorelDraw ðŸ’°
- Adobe Illustrator ðŸ’°
- [InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org/) (free, has [plug-ins] for bobbin lace)

Advanced usages
---------------
The sections below the diagram are for advanced users.
As the page is still under construction (for example no automated footsides yet),
the demo section is the only help yet to fill in the repeats and pattern sections
for new patterns.
