Tiles
=====

The [tiles] page is a variant of the [home] page.
On the tiles page you can't use thread diagrams as pair diagrams,
but you don't have to [assign] stitches to id's.
It has only two colors in the thread diagram,
but you don't need to [calculate] thread counts
to give the desired ones a color.

Catalogues
----------
The tooltip for the catalogues lists most of the individual pages.
Those that link back to the tiles pages are listed as links.
Other catalogue pages link to the diagrams on the main page.
Follow the main catalogues links for short introductions.
_For as long as the page is still under construction,
you may choose a link from the image captions of the demo section
on the tiles page itself._

The links from a catalogue page fill out the forms below the diagrams.
These forms define a base pattern, advanced users may design
new base patterns with these forms.

You can vary stitches for the base patterns and check how
contrasting threads would travel through the ground.


Choose stitches
---------------
The faint nodes in the prototype diagram are repeats of the bright ones.
Click on a bright nodes and a yellow form field should emerge with a code
for a stitch, for example `ctc` for a cloth stitch: cross-twist-cross.
Type as many `c`'s and `t`'s as you need for the stitch of your choice,
or use `l`'s and `r`'s for a left twist or right twist.

Microsofts Edge browser won't show the yellow form field when clicking a node.
Use the tab key or shift-tab to browse through all fields and links on the page.

Toggle thread colors
--------------------
You may have to scroll/drag the pair diagram to make
the squares at the start of the threads visible.
Click these squares to toggle between a black or red color.

A tooltip shows when your mouse hovers over a square. 
Too tiny squares or too close together? Use the zoom function of your browser.
Usually control-shift-plus to zoom in, control-zero to reset,
on a mac use command for control.

Download
--------
You can download the diagrams to edit them with an [SVG editor] such as:
- CorelDraw ðŸ’°
- Adobe Illustrator ðŸ’°
- [InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org/) (free)

Note the [plug-ins] for bobbin lace available for the latter,
one wraps prickings for Tesselace grounds around a circle.

Advanced usages
---------------
The sections below the diagram are for advanced users.
As the page is still under construction (for example no automated footsides yet),
the demo section is the only help yet to fill in the repeats and pattern sections
for new patterns.
