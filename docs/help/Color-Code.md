Color code dialects
-------------------

Various dialects of color codes for pair diagrams are used by bobbin lace designers:
a [Belgian] version, a simplified [Danish] version, a [red-blue] version and perhaps more.
Allowing -even encouraging- unorthodox stitches, the liberty to use both open and closed stitches,
poor or no support for tallies, pins and gimps in GroundForge and other limitations asks for yet another dialect.

Twist marks by GroundForge
--------------------------

The intention is a twist mark wherever there are multiple twists in a pair.
Open stitches abide this rule. Closed stitches lack twist marks if just one of the pairs need one.

Follow the progress of issue [#104](https://github.com/d-bl/GroundForge/issues/104).

Colors by GroundForge
---------------------

A stitch-pin-stitch is not drawn as "ê…‰" (pins are hardly supported anyway) and 
a plait in a pair diagram is not drawn as ">---<" but both as "X".

stitch name         | color      | examples and notes (neither are exhaustive)
--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------
half stitch         | green      | `ct`, `tc`, `ttc`, `tct` (just one time `c` and both pairs twisted at least once)
cloth stitch        | purple     | `ctc`, `ctcl`, `rctc` (just `ctc` and at most on pair twisted)
2x half stitches    | red        | `ctct`, `tctc`, `ctct` (just `ctc` and both pairs twisted at least once)
plait               | blue       | `ctctc` (a `c` followed by at least two times `tc`)
turning stitch      | turquoise  | `cttc` (no more than two times `c`)
,, variants         | brown      | `cllc`, `crrc`, `ctlc`, `ctrc`

Stitches not matching anything above will be black.


Tweak Colors
------------

A pair diagram has a predefined palette of colors applied to stitches. You can tweak colors to accommodate your monitor, printer or color-blindness.

Download a pair diagram and open it with some plain text editor (or show it full screen and right click to show the page source), you will see a start/end marker definition for each color except black, something like:
```xml
<svg ...>
  <g>
    <defs>
      ...
      <marker id="start-red" ...><path ... stroke="#f00"></path></marker>
      ...
    </defs>
  </g>
  ...
</svg>
```

Change the stroke value to adjust a color, several color choosers on the web can provide a RGB value. Save the changes and open the file again in your browser or SVG editor and you will see the adjusted colors all over the diagram.
