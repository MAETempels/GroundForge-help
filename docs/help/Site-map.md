Site Map
========

The diagram (with legend) below gives an overview of the pages and how to navigate between them,
a [clickable version](https://cdn.rawgit.com/d-bl/GroundForge/ed3005d13e58f5bb3de87eecd599e99286dd2dc5/docs/help/images/site-map.svg).

The main page (index.html) has a workaround for a bug in IE-11 which tiles.html hasn't.
The latter supports only black and red threads but choosing them is more intuitive
what also applies to choosing stitches.

Pair diagrams come in roughly two styles:
* a square grid (on `tiles.html` and `sheet.html`)
* round holes (on `tiles.html` and `index.html`)

Many squared diagrams can result in the same rounded diagram.
