Site Map
========

The clickable diagram (with legend) below gives an overview of the pages
and how to navigate between them.

The page tiles.html supports only black and red threads but choosing them is more intuitive
what also applies to choosing stitches.
Currently a bug can assign the chosen stitches incorrectly
in the animated diagrams.

The main page (index.html) has a workaround for a bug in IE-11
for the animated diagrams which tiles.html hasn't, the Edge browser doesn't have this bug.


Pair diagrams come in roughly two styles:
* a square grid (on `tiles.html` and `sheet.html`)
* rounded holes (on `tiles.html` and `index.html`)

Many squared diagrams can result in the same rounded diagram.
