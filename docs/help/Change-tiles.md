Change the tiling of a pattern
==============================

Patterns can have different types and sizes of tiles, each having their pros and cons.
This page shows the proces of changing the tile definition.

See also [tutorial](Advanced#glue-copies-together) pages for related subjects.

An example pattern

The image below shows an annotated definition of ground

The faint stitches repeat the bright ones. The green 2x4 rectangles around the stitches show that the repetition has a brick layout.
The 3x3 purple tile looks more like a unit presented in traditional text books.
The larger purple tiles allows you to vary stitches in more units. 

The procedure
-------------
An animation (for the 3x3 tile) disambiguates the steps below.
The <a href="images/brick-to-overlap-animation.gif" target="_blank">animation</a>
should appear in a new tab or window, reload that page to restart.

* Type the characters in the tile of your choice in the second text field.
* Select a tile layout:
  * The left blue square for the 4x4 or 4x8 purple tile, and you are done.
    The 4x8 tile works also with the brick layout.
  * The right blue square for the 3x3 purple tile and continue with the following steps.
* Move the purple tile until you have proper diagonals.
* Then move the green tile to get the diagonals together.
* Any textbook will explain the bottom corners of the unit are the top corners for the next row.
  We saw this happen when moving the tiles in place.
  Make these stitches faint with a dash.
  Having these stitches up to now might help to check the tiles arrived at their target: they blend. 

Subsequently, you will have to adjust what stitches to make at each grid position to get the original thread diagram.
Use two browser windows, one with the old tile layout, one with the new tile layout.
Then you can copy-paste the corresponding stitches.
